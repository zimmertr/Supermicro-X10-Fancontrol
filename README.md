# Supermicro X10 Fancontrol

## Summary

This script is used to dynamically control the fan duty cycle (speed) on a Supermicro X10 server by calculating the current percentage of the maximum operating temperature of a CPU and setting the duty cycle of the fans to the equivalent percentage of their maximum speed. 

For example, if your CPU's maximum operating temperature is 79Â°C, and the current reading is 40 is is at ~51% of the threshold. The fan speeds will then be set to 51% accordingly. If the desired duty cycle results in a lower RPM than the Lower Critical threshold of the fans in the pool, the Lower Critical treshold will be used as the duty cycle instead to avoid the BMC overriding the configuraiton.
